                                The space industry faces a critical infrastructure challenge: ground station access is expensive, centralized, and inefficient. Satellite operators struggle with limited coverage while existing ground stations sit underutilized. We built DecentSpace to create a marketplace that transforms how the space industry communicates with satellites, democratizing access while rewarding participation.

                                By 2030, over 28,000 satellites will be in orbit, creating unprecedented demand for ground station capacity. Traditional solutions can't scale efficiently to meet this need. Our decentralized network approach turns this challenge into an opportunity by enabling anyone with suitable hardware to join the network and provide essential communications infrastructure.

                                Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks enable secure, transparent, and trustless coordination between satellite operators and ground station owners. Smart contracts automate scheduling, payment, and quality verification without middlemen. This creates a self-sustaining network where participants are fairly rewarded for their contributions, while cryptographic verification ensures reliable service quality.

This value-sharing approach ensures sustainable growth and aligns the interests of all participants for long-term success.
